## Intro
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share bits and pieces from my homelab adventures, coding projects, and whatever else Iâ€™m tinkering with.

Itâ€™s half personal notebook, half portfolio â€” a place to keep track of things Iâ€™ve built (or broken). Maybe help someone else along the way, or maybe impress someone from LinkedIn!

Stick around if youâ€™re into self-hosting, programming side projects, or just want to see what Iâ€™ve been up to lately.

I might even start writing about my garage or outdoors adventures, coming soon:tm: (you know what soon:tm: means, right?)

{{< timelineItem icon="briefcase" header="Software Engineer II" subheader="Anomali" badge="2022 - Present">}}
<p>Helped <strong>move a huge production codebase from Python 2 â†’ Python 3</strong>, keeping things running smoothly while making them faster and more capable.</p>
<p>Led a <strong>major upgrade of our cache database format</strong>, which sped up execution times and cut storage needs way down.</p>
<p>Built a <strong>fast intelligence scraping engine</strong> that shipped ahead of schedule and made customers happy.</p>
<p>Gave the <strong>ThreatStream Splunk app</strong> a big refresh â€” itâ€™s now the most popular threat intel app on Splunkbase.</p>
<p>Rolled out <strong>better workflows with Jira and GitHub</strong>, plus wrote automation to make PRs, reviews, and testing way less painful.</p>
<p>These days, Iâ€™m focused on <strong>vendor integrations with Google</strong>, improving our <strong>cache logic</strong>, building out <strong>GitHub Actions workflows</strong>, and <strong>automating monitoring for our threat intelligence feeds</strong> so we catch issues faster.</p>
