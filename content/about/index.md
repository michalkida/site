## Intro
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share bits and pieces from my homelab adventures, coding projects, and whatever else Iâ€™m tinkering with.

Itâ€™s half personal notebook, half portfolio â€” a place to keep track of things Iâ€™ve built (or broken). Maybe help someone else along the way, or maybe impress someone from LinkedIn!

Stick around if youâ€™re into self-hosting, programming side projects, or just want to see what Iâ€™ve been up to lately.

I might even start writing about my garage or outdoors adventures, coming soon:tm: (you know what soon:tm: means, right?)

## Professional Experience

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timelineItem icon="briefcase" header="Software Engineer II" subheader="Anomali" badge="2022 - Present" md="true">}}
Helped **move a huge production codebase from Python 2 â†’ Python 3**, keeping things running smoothly while making them faster and more capable.

Led a **major upgrade of our cache database format**, which sped up execution times and cut storage needs way down.

Built a **fast intelligence scraping engine** that shipped ahead of schedule and made customers happy.

Gave the **ThreatStream Splunk app** a big refresh â€” itâ€™s now the most popular threat intel app on Splunkbase.

Rolled out **better workflows with Jira and GitHub**, plus wrote automation to make PRs, reviews, and testing way less painful.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on **vendor integrations with Google**, improving our **cache logic**, building out **GitHub Actions workflows**, and **automating monitoring for our threat intelligence feeds** so we catch issues faster.

Achieved an average **accuracy and F1-score of 89% and 87.5%** for country and APT group classification, while **significantly reducing processing time** compared to existing solutions.
