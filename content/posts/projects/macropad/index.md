This project started when I saw an image of a cool standalone numpad with an OLED display. With my 60% keyboard and no numpad (â€¦plus that OLED display), I knew I had to build one.  

After some browsing, I settled on the **Adafruit MacroPad RP2040**, which had the perfect number of keys, LEDs, an OLED display, and was fully programmable with **CircuitPython**.  

I found an existing GitHub repository with basic functionality and expanded on it. My favorite feature is **Spotify control**: combining the MacroPad with **AutoHotkeyâ€™s DllCall**, I can send keystrokes directly to the Spotify clientâ€”even if itâ€™s minimised or on another monitor. This includes:

- Controlling the appâ€™s volume (not system-wide)  
- Skipping tracks  
- Seeking  
- Playing/pausing  

However, modern anticheat solutions (looking at you javelin) don't find this nowhere near as cool because any use of AHK is apparently bad ðŸ¥²

I also 3D printed a case for it (as the unit only comes with a backplate leaving a gap between the pad and itself), and fitted it with some Cherry MX Brown switches for that nice sound. Did I mention its fully hotswappable?
