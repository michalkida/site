Hi, I’m **Michał** — a backend developer with a love for self-hosting, automation, and tinkering on the tech side of things.

When I’m not at a keyboard, I’m usually working on my car or motorbike and trying to go fast, trying to keep up with Garmin's running workouts, or spending time in the outdoors.

This site is where I share my projects, experiments, and notes about things I enjoy.
